This is an ecommerce for a handmade necklace shop. It was built using Sanity as a headless CMS to manage the content of products ðŸ“‚, NextJS as the framework of React ðŸ›  and also Stripe to allow full secure payments ðŸ”’. 

(Although this is a test application, all necklaces are actually on sale so checkout their Instagram in the footer of the page. The logo was design by me, by the way ðŸ˜‰)

It involves context provider for shared data across the app, API connection with Sanity and Stripe, landing page, cart, products page, details page for every product, payment screen provided by Stripe.
