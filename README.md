## Ecommerce
> [!TIP]
> This project is available on the web, go take a look ðŸ‘‰ [SyS Webpage](https://sys-ecommerce.vercel.app/).

This is an ecommerce for a handmade necklace shop. It was built using Sanity as a headless CMS to manage the content of products ðŸ“‚, NextJS as the framework of React ðŸ›  and also Stripe to allow full secure payments ðŸ”’. 

It involves context provider for shared data across the app, API connection with Sanity and Stripe, landing page, cart, products page, details page for every product, payment screen provided by Stripe.

> (Although this is a test application, all necklaces are actually on sale so checkout their Instagram in the footer of the page. The logo was design by me, by the way ðŸ˜‰)
